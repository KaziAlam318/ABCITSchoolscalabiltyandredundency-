This Project is based on a realistic IT School with 1800-2000 concurrent users using an AWS Server. In some cases, user traffic spikes at a very high volume, which creates a challenge for the server to accommodate. As an AWS Solutions Architect, I have tried to frame a well-constructed plan that offers scalability and redundancy. The Step-by-Step Solutions will help you understand how a running server can be managed better.
